Javascript the Good Parts by _Douglas Crockford_ calls out all the best parts of Javascript and tells you what to avoid (the 'bad parts'). It's about making sure you know the really important parts of the language and create good habits instead of having to break bad ones down the line.

The idea of these notes is to collect the excellent information from an already dense book into note form, translating these ideas into 'plain English' where possible and adding explanations throughout where the book might not make things obvious as it assumes some programming language.

I hope to keep making them simpler as I understand more. So here they are, I hope they help.
